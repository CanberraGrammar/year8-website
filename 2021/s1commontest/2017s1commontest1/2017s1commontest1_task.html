			<h2>Task Description</h2>
			
			<ul>
			
				<li><strong>Time:</strong> You have 45 minutes to complete this task.</li>
						
				<li><strong>Required:</strong> You need to create a web page which <strong>EXACTLY</strong> replicates the content and layout of the page shown below (which is a screenshot, so you cannot copy and paste anything from this example).</li>
						
				<li><strong>Validation:</strong> Your HTML page must <strong>FULLY</strong> validate (i.e. with no warnings or errors) as <strong>XHTML 1.0 Strict</strong> using the W3C validator located at <a href="http://validator.w3.org/">http://validator.w3.org</a>. <strong>Your CSS file does not need to validate</strong>.</li>
			
				<li><strong>Template Files:</strong> You must use the template provided for this task. They are available in ED STEM as <strong>Semester One Common Test (Template)</strong>. Make sure you fork and use this template.</li>
				
				<li><strong>Time Saver:</strong> To help you save time, the CSS file has been linked to the HTML file, and the HTML template file validates as XHTML 1.0 Strict.</li>
				
				<li><strong>Submission:</strong> Once you are done there is no need to submit your files - however <strong>DO NOT</strong> change your ED STEM workspace. We will be actively checking the revision history of the workspace for any changes made after the test session.</li>

Mixed reality: Your world is the canvas

Microsoft HoloLens is the first self-contained, holographic computer, enabling you to engage with your digital content and interact with holograms in the world around you.

Holographic computing made possible

Specialized components—like multiple sensors, advanced optics, and a custom holographic processing unit—enable us to go beyond the screen.

Gaze

Gaze is the first form of input and is a primary form of targeting within mixed reality. Gaze tells you where the user is looking in the world and lets you determine their intent.

Mixed reality headsets use the position and orientation of your user's head, not their eyes, to determine their gaze vector. You can think of this vector as a laser pointer straight ahead from directly between the user's eyes. As the user looks around the room, your application can intersect this ray, both with its own holograms and with the spatial mapping mesh to determine what virtual or real-world object your user may be looking at.

Gestures

Gestures allow users take action in mixed reality with their hands. For HoloLens, gesture input lets you interact with your holograms naturally, or you can optionally use the included HoloLens Clicker. While hands gestures do not provide a precise location in space, the simplicity of putting on a HoloLens and immediately interacting with content allows users to get to work without any accessories. HoloLens recognizes gesture input by tracking the position of either or both hands that are visible to the device. HoloLens sees hands when they are in either the ready state (back of the hand facing you with index finger up) or the pressed state (back of the hand facing you with the index finger down). When hands are in other poses, the HoloLens will ignore them.

Voice

Users will use gaze, gesture and voice (GGV) as the primary means of interacting with your content on HoloLens.

The interaction model on HoloLens is GG and GV. Users will use gaze with either gestures or voice to complete their interactions. While designing apps, you should consider how you can make these interactions work together well.

			<h3>Annotated Page</h3>
			
			<p>An annotated version of the page is provided below giving you with key information so that you can replicate the page.</p>
			
			<ul>
				<li>All the images you need are provided in the template ED STEM workspace.</li>
				<li>Here are the link destinations for: <a href="https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/mixed-reality/spatial_mapping">spatial mapping</a> and <a href="https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/mixed-reality/Hardware_accessories.html#hololens_clicker">HoloLens Clicker</a>.</li>
				<li>If a height is not defined on the annotated page then it is the default height - no special adjustments have been made in those cases.</li>
