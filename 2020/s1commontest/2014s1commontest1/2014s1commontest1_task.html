			<h2>Task Description</h2>
			
			<ul>
			
				<li><strong>Time:</strong> You have 45 minutes to complete this task.</li>
						
				<li><strong>Required:</strong> You need to create a web page which <strong>EXACTLY</strong> replicates the content and layout of the page shown below (which is a screenshot, so you cannot copy and paste anything from this example).</li>
						
				<li><strong>Validation:</strong> Your HTML page must <strong>FULLY</strong> validate (i.e. with no warnings or errors) as XHTML 1.0 Strict using the W3C validator located at <a href="http://validator.w3.org">http://validator.w3.org</a>. <strong>Your CSS file does not need to validate</strong>.</li>
			
				<li><strong>Template Files:</strong> You must use the two template files provided to complete this task. They have been uploaded to your webspace and are named <strong><a href="template/commontest.html">commontest.html</a></strong> and <strong><a href="template/commontest.css">commontest.css</a></strong> accessible in the <strong>commontest</strong> folder. <strong>You may rename these files, but must NOT move or rename the commontest folder.</strong></li>
								
				<li><strong>Time Saver:</strong> To help you save time, the CSS file has been linked to the HTML file, and the HTML template file validates as XHTML 1.0 Strict.</li>
							
				<li><strong>Submission:</strong> Once you are done there is no need to submit your files - they will be downloaded from your ShiftEdit webspace remotely for marking, immediately following the conclusion of this test.</li>

Overview

Google Glass is a wearable computer with an optical head-mounted display (OHMD) that is being developed by Google in the Project Glass research and development project, with a mission of producing a mass-market ubiquitous computer. Google Glass displays information in a smartphone-like hands-free format, that can communicate with the Internet via natural language voice commands.

Glass is being developed by Google X [1], which has worked on other technologies such as driverless cars. The project was announced on Google+ by Project Glass lead Babak Parviz, an electrical engineer who has also worked on putting displays into contact lenses; Steve Lee, a product manager and "geolocation specialist"; and Sebastian Thrun, who developed Udacity as well as worked on the autonomous car project. Google has patented the design of Project Glass. Thad Starner, an augmented reality expert, is a technical lead/manager on the project.

Features

Touchpad
A touchpad is located on the side of Google Glass, allowing users to control the device by swiping through a timeline-like interface displayed on the screen. Sliding backward shows current events, such as weather, and sliding forward shows past events, such as phone calls, photos, circle updates, etc.

Camera
Google Glass has the ability to take photos and record 720p HD video. While video is recording, the screen stays on while it is doing so.				

Display
The Explorer version of Google Glass uses a Liquid Crystal on Silicon (LCoS), field-sequential color, LED illuminated display.

The display's LED illumination is first P-polarized and then shines through the in-coupling polarizing beam splitter (PBS) to the LCoS panel. The panel reflects the light and alters it to S-polarization at active pixel sites. The in-coupling PBS then reflects the S-polarized areas of light at 45&deg; [2] through the out-coupling beam splitter to a collimating reflector at the other end. Finally, the out-coupling beam splitter (which is a partially reflecting mirror, not a polarizing beam splitter) reflects the collimated light another 45&deg; [2] and into the wearer's eye.
