			<h2>Task Description</h2>
			
			<ul>
			
				<li><strong>Time:</strong> You have 45 minutes to complete this task.</li>
						
				<li><strong>Required:</strong> You need to create a web page which <strong>EXACTLY</strong> replicates the content and layout of the page shown below (which is a screenshot, so you cannot copy and paste anything from this example).</li>
						
				<li><strong>Validation:</strong> Your HTML page must <strong>FULLY</strong> validate (i.e. with no warnings or errors) as XHTML 1.0 Strict using the W3C validator located at <a href="http://validator.w3.org">http://validator.w3.org</a>. <strong>Your CSS file does not need to validate</strong>.</li>
			
				<li><strong>Template Files:</strong> You must use the two template files provided to complete this task. They have been uploaded to your webspace and are named <strong><a href="template/commontest.html">commontest.html</a></strong> and <strong><a href="template/commontest.css">commontest.css</a></strong> accessible in the <strong>s1commontest</strong> folder. <strong>DO NOT rename these files and DO NOT rename the s1commontest folder.</strong></li>
								
				<li><strong>Time Saver:</strong> To help you save time, the CSS file has been linked to the HTML file, and the HTML template file validates as XHTML 1.0 Strict.</li>
				
				<li><strong>Submission:</strong> Once you are done there is no need to submit your files - they will be downloaded from your ShiftEdit webspace remotely for marking, immediately following the conclusion of this test.</li>
