			<h2>Task Description</h2>
			
			<ul>
			
				<li><strong>Time:</strong> You have 45 minutes to complete this task.</li>
						
				<li><strong>Required:</strong> You need to create a web page which <strong>EXACTLY</strong> replicates the content and layout of the page shown below (which is a screenshot, so you cannot copy and paste anything from this example).</li>
						
				<li><strong>Validation:</strong> Your HTML page must <strong>FULLY</strong> validate (i.e. with no warnings or errors) as HTML5 using the W3C validator located at <a href="http://validator.w3.org">http://validator.w3.org</a>. <strong>Your CSS file does not need to validate</strong>.</li>
			
				<li><strong>Template Files:</strong> You must use the two template files provided to complete this task. They have been uploaded to your webspace and are named <strong><a href="template/commontest.html">commontest.html</a></strong> and <strong><a href="template/commontest.css">commontest.css</a></strong> accessible in the <strong>s1commontest2016</strong> folder. <strong>DO NOT rename these files and DO NOT rename the s1commontest folder.</strong></li>
								
				<li><strong>Time Saver:</strong> To help you save time, the CSS file has been linked to the HTML file, and the HTML template file validates as HTML5.</li>
				
				<li><strong>Submission:</strong> Once you are done there is no need to submit your files - they will be downloaded from your ShiftEdit webspace remotely for marking, immediately following the conclusion of this test.</li>

HTC Vive
"Best of CES 2016" - Android Authority

Once you put on the Vive headset, you’re immersed in a world full of surprises. Walk around freely and explore everything–the Chaperone guidance system keeps you safely within the bounds of your play area. Stunning graphics make it feel so real and surreal simultaneously.

Revolutionary Control
HD haptic feedback and intuitive gestures mean playing games and interacting with the virtual world comes naturally. Vive’s two wireless controllers feature 24 sensors for unobstructed movement, meaning you can do more in VR than ever before.

Precise Spatial Tracking
You get 360&deg; motion tracking with Vive thanks to breakthrough base station technology that helps the headset and controllers track their exact location in space. Freely explore and interact with the virtual world. Room-scale VR puts you at the centre of everything.

Recommended systems include:
The HP ENVY Phoenix [1]
The Alienware X-51 [2]
The MSI VR-Ready range [3]
