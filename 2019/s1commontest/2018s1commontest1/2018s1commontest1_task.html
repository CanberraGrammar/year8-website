			<h2>Task Description</h2>
			
			<ul>
			
				<li><strong>Time:</strong> You have 45 minutes to complete this task.</li>
						
				<li><strong>Required:</strong> You need to create a web page which <strong>EXACTLY</strong> replicates the content and layout of the page shown below (which is a screenshot, so you cannot copy and paste anything from this example).</li>
						
				<li><strong>Validation:</strong> Your HTML page must <strong>FULLY</strong> validate (i.e. with no warnings or errors) as <strong>XHTML 1.0 Strict</strong> using the W3C validator located at <a target="_blank" href="http://validator.w3.org/">http://validator.w3.org</a>. <strong>Your CSS file does not need to validate</strong>.</li>
			
				<li><strong>Template Files:</strong> You must use the template provided for this task. They are available in ED STEM as <strong>Semester One Common Test (Template)</strong>. Make sure you fork and use this template.</li>
				
				<li><strong>Time Saver:</strong> To help you save time, the CSS file has been linked to the HTML file, and the HTML template file validates as XHTML 1.0 Strict.</li>
				
				<li><strong>Submission:</strong> Once you are done there is no need to submit your files - however <strong>DO NOT</strong> change your ED STEM workspace. We will be actively checking the revision history of the workspace for any changes made after the test session.</li>

We're building the world's most experienced driver

Waymo began as the Google self-driving car project in 2009.

Today, we're an independent self-driving technology company with a mission to make it safe and easy for everyone to get around—without the need for anyone in the driver’s seat.

How it works

Our vehicles have sensors and software that are designed to detect pedestrians, cyclists, vehicles, road work and more from up to three football fields away in all 360 degrees.

Example situation

In the following situation, our vehicle is about to drive straight across an intersection with many other road users nearby, including a cyclist up ahead.

Our sensors and software detect and predict the behavior of not only the cyclist, but of all the road users around us.

We rely on 5 million miles of real world experience to teach our cars to navigate safely and comfortably through everyday traffic.

On the road

When it comes to driving, experience is the best teacher.

We’ve put our technology through the world’s longest and toughest ongoing driving test.

Each day, our vehicles can be found test driving on closed courses, on public roads, and in simulation.

Safe navigation

Our sensors observe that the cyclist has extended their left arm.

Detecting the cyclist's hand signal, our software predicts that the cyclist will move to the left side of the lane.

Our software plans for our vehicle to slow down and make room for the cyclist to pass safely and comfortably ahead of us.

The world around us

1.25 million

deaths worldwide due to vehicle crashes in 2014
