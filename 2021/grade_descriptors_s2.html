<td class="tableblock halign-left valign-middle"><p class="tableblock">The student demonstrates an extensive knowledge of the JavaScript programming language, particularly writing correct code syntax, creating and using variables, and implementing control structures. Additionally, their code is very well written incorporating whitespace, indentation, and commenting. They also have a highly competent knowledge of object-oriented programming, particularly creating and using custom objects. The student has mastered the logical design patterns required to create algorithms to address and solve complex programming problems. Furthermore, they are able to translate these algorithms into source code which can be interpreted and run as a working application. The student is also highly proficient in advanced JavaScript programming concepts including functions, handling events, and interacting with web pages through accessing and manipulating the Document Object Model.</p></td>

<td class="tableblock halign-left valign-middle"><p class="tableblock">The student demonstrates a sound knowledge of the JavaScript programming language, including writing correct code syntax, creating and using variables, and implementing control structures. They also have a working knowledge of object-oriented programming, particularly creating and using custom objects. The student has a satisfactory understanding of the logical design patterns required to create algorithms to address and solve complex programming problems. They have a sound grasp of advanced JavaScript programming concepts and can follow instructions to implement functions, handle events, and interact with web pages through accessing and manipulating the Document Object Model. To improve, they should further develop their knowledge of complex programming concepts and algorithms, through writing more advanced programs, along with practising the use of advanced JavaScript techniques.</p></td>

They only have a basic knowledge of object-oriented programming. Their understanding of more advanced JavaScript programming concepts, including functions and web page interaction, is also very limited and they require substantial guidance and step-by-step instructions. To improve, the student should further practise the logical design patterns to create algorithms which address and solve complex programming problems. They also need to ensure that they properly read all provided material and understand the concepts before trying to implement in code.</p></td>
