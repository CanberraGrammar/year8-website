			<h2>Task Description</h2>

			<ul>

				<li><strong>Time:</strong> You have 45 minutes to complete this task.</li>

				<li><strong>Required:</strong> You need to create a web page which <strong>EXACTLY</strong> replicates the content and layout of the page shown below (which is a screenshot, so you cannot copy and paste anything from this example).</li>

				<li><strong>Validation:</strong> Your HTML page must <strong>FULLY</strong> validate (i.e. with no warnings or errors) as <strong>XHTML 1.0 Strict</strong> using the W3C validator located at <a href="http://validator.w3.org/">http://validator.w3.org</a>. <strong>Your CSS file does not need to validate</strong>.</li>

				<li><strong>Template Files:</strong> You must use the template provided for this task. They are available in ED STEM as <strong>Semester One Common Test (Task &#38; Template)</strong>. Make sure you fork and use this template.</li>

				<li><strong>Time Saver:</strong> To help you save time, the CSS file has been linked to the HTML file, and the HTML template file validates as XHTML 1.0 Strict.</li>

				<li><strong>Submission:</strong> Once you are done there is no need to submit your files - however <strong>DO NOT</strong> change your ED STEM workspace. We will be actively checking the revision history of the workspace for any changes made after the test session.</li>

Comic Sans

Comic Sans is a script typeface that is used inappropriately so much that it is probably the most hated font in the world. That makes it an obvious choice for my list of interesting fonts.

What does Comic Sans look like?

Here is a little poem to show off Comic Sans.

Of course, several styles are available. Below the regular and bold version are compared.

Comic Sans Regular

Comic Sans Bold

What do you use Comic Sans for?

As its name implies, Comic Sans is a good choice for comic book style talk bubbles. It can also be used as display type for anything that needs to have a friendly and informal look to it. It is not very suitable for e-mails, body text, presentations, name cards for anyone over 12 or corporate communication.

The history of Comic Sans

Vincent Connare created Comic Sans in 1994 while working for Microsoft. It was designed for ‘Bob’, a virtual assistant that would help kids and novice users launch programs and do simple tasks. Connare used the lettering of ‘The Dark Knight Returns’ and ‘Watchmen’ comics as a source of inspiration and originally even intended to name the font ‘Comic Book’.

In the end Microsoft did not use Comic Sans for the virtual assistant but it did use it in a number of other Windows ’95 related products, including Internet Explorer. The typeface quickly became very popular but it was abused so much that an anti-Comic Sans movement erupted.</pre>
